# Face & Eye Detection with Sunglasses Overlay
This project provides a real-time face and eye detection application using OpenCV. It includes an optional feature to overlay sunglasses on detected faces, adding a fun twist to the traditional face detection.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar cascades.
- Eye detection within detected faces.
- Optional sunglasses overlay on detected faces.
- Trackbar to enable or disable the sunglasses overlay.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Code Structure

- `face_eye_detection.py`: The main script containing the `FaceDetector` class and the `main` function to run the application.
- `dealwithit.png`: The sunglasses image used for the overlay.
